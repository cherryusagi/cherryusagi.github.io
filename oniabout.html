        <h2>Origin & History</h2>
        
        <p>The Office of Naval Intelligence, known as the Naval Intelligence Enterprise (NIE), is American history's longest-serving national intelligence agency. Often considered the crown jewel in the Navy’s Information Warfare communities, its mission to protect the American people from maritime threats is tireless and everlasting. With the organization’s establishment in 1882, its prestige and technical prowess have set ONI apart from similar international organizations. The organization's main targets are gathering, analyzing, compartmentalizing, and utilizing maritime intelligence. ONI’s innovative creation and continued excellence have aided in the continued funding and operation of the branch. </p>
        <p> The American Navy lagged far behind the international community during its creation. With European, Chinese, and other countries' navies utilizing far more advanced technologies and infrastructures, the Navy’s ships were still made of wood. The cultural zeitgeist surrounding American military might and international control was widely unaware of the Navy. After the First World War, this notion was challenged by Lieutenant Theodorus Bailey Myers Mason. An agent of innovation, the young soldier realized the niche of maritime intelligence collection and sought America’s capitalization. William H. Hunt, as chief of the Naval Advisory Board (NAB), had been inspired by Mason’s ideas and, on March 23, 188, issued General Order No. 292. It read: “An "Office of Intelligence" is established in the Bureau of Navigation to collect and record such naval information as may be useful to the Department in time of war and peace.” </p>

        <p> 1916 marked a significant turning point for the Office of Naval Intelligence. Congress authorized the first major expansion of ONI's personnel and budget, with the government realizing its significance as the first organized data-gathering agency. ONI continued its expansion by assisting and working closely with the Department of Justice (DOJ), state, federal, civil organizations, and individuals. The progression towards another world war further motivated the US to continue the expansion of ONI’s territories and duties. In 1946, the establishment of the Operational Intelligence Section, a special Y1 designation, was a discrete team of dedicated operatives whose mission was to intercept communications through the Japanese Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Navy Field Operational Intelligence Office (NFOIO), established in 1957, was another sector created following agents' extraordinary success during WWII. The ONI's point person in the surveillance of the Japanese American community on the West Coast was Kenneth Ringle, the assistant district intelligence officer for the Eleventh Naval District in Los Angeles. Ringle's and the ONI's views were largely ignored by the army, which successfully pressed for the mass removal of all Japanese Americans from the West Coast. As Japanese American internment continued, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) became involved in assessing the "loyalty" of individuals seeking release from the camps in 1943–44 under the Japanese American Joint Board. ONI maintained surveillance of the Japanese American community both within the camps and during resettlement. For instance, a 30-page "Counter-Intelligence Report on Recent Developments in Japanese Situation, Twelfth Naval District" was issued on March 28, 1945. The report covered developments in the first quarter of 1945, focusing on early returnees to the West Coast and conditions at Manzanar, Topaz, and Tule Lake.</p>
        <p>In the modern era, ONI’s storied history is the backbone of its operation and core values. With a focus on technology and new areas of exploitation, ONI has absorbed intelligence agencies within the US government to regulate and streamline the flow of imperative information. As the millennium shifted, the agency received a designation as part of the Information Warfare Community within the federal ranks and continues to supply the Navy and government with critical, accurate, and relevant maritime foreign intelligence. </p>

        <h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
       
        <p>ONI’s structure is explicitly stated to assist with the Navy’s war capabilities regarding cyberwarfare, weapons, sensors, new technologies, and other related duties. The official hierarchy remains a classified topic. However, a unique facet is their reliance on civilian and reserve agents to remain at full capability. According to the facts sheet, “ONI employs approximately 3,000 military, civilian, mobilized reservists and contractor personnel worldwide, including analysts, scientists, engineers, specialists and technicians. It also has the support of more than 800 Navy reservists who provide the equivalent of over 90 man-years of production during weekend drill and active duty periods.” (ONI, 2017) Maintaining it is strength through sheer manpower is an easily conquered obstacle; however, what differentiates the organization is the diversity in skillsets and human experience. With niches and specializations across the board, the US Navy utilizes its special agents to protect citizens and the international community from incoming threats. The hierarchy is also shrouded in secrecy. However, the highest-ranking official positions are public knowledge. ONI is led by a commander, formally known as the Commander, Office of Naval Intelligence (COMONI), who also serves as Director of the National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office (NMIIO), the national intelligence community center for maritime issues under ONI. The Deputy Commander acts as the primary assistant and adviser to the Commander. The Chief Staff Officer oversees the staff directors and officers and is the main point of contact for other commands. The Command Master Chief leads the enlisted personnel and advises the Commander, Deputy Commander, and Chief Staff Officer on command policies.</p>
        <p>ONI also supports international customers and businesses with a wide range of services and products. While initially and during the formation and structuring of its community, there may have been fractures in differing departments, today, ONI’s command remains steadfast and emphasizes communication between differing sectors. </p>

        <h3>Headquarters & Field Locations</h3>
        
        
        <p>Due to the unique nature of wargaming, the Navy and its constituents operate from many differing locations, with national and international locations that agencies may be assigned to. Geographical offerings may differ between reserve, civilian, and seamen; however, the latter is closely guarded, and information is largely unavailable. </p>
        <p>Maryland serves as the headquarters for the Navy’s Information Warfare Community, with the official headquarters located in the National Maritime Intelligence Center federal grounds. The address is listed as 4251 Suitland Road, Suitland, MD 20746. This facility has four separate centers of excellence, one of whom is ONI and its operatives. The Nimitz Operational Intelligence Center, the Farragut Technical Analysis Center, the Kennedy Irregular Warfare Center, the Hopper Information Services Center, and the Brooks Center for Maritime Engagement are all potential satellite offices the Navy operates out of. Numerous aircraft carriers and Navy ships all employ a rotating set of individuals who work for ONI. </p>
