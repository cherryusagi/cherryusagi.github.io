        <h2>Join ONI</h2>
        <p>To be employed with ONI, an individual has multiple routes to take. The blend of reserve, civilian, and navy personnel throughout the ranks offers many positions that may be of interest. There are also ONI police officer positions that can be applied for, a unique blend of L.E.O. service and intelligence analysis. Potential candidates must fit into one of three categories defined by ONI below.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Competitive service</strong></p>
        <p>Competitive service positions are subject to the civil service laws passed by Congress to ensure that applicants and employees receive fair and equal treatment in the hiring process. In the competitive service, individuals must undergo a competitive hiring process (i.e., competitive examination) before being appointed, which is open to all applicants. This process may consist of a written test, an evaluation of the individual’s education and experience, and/or other attributes necessary for successful performance in the position to be filled.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Excepted service</strong></p>
        <p>Excepted service positions are federal or civil service positions not in the competitive or Senior Executive Service. Excepted service agencies set their qualification requirements and are not subject to the appointment, pay, and classification rules in Title 5, United States Code. However, they are subject to veterans’ preference.
            There are several ways to be appointed into the excepted service, such as appointed under an authority defined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (O.P.M.) as excepted (e.g., Veterans Recruitment Appointment) or being appointed to a position determined by O.P.M. as excepted (e.g., Attorneys). More information can be found about excepted service in 5 U.S.C. 2103 and parts 213 and 302 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Senior Executive Service</strong></p>
        <p>The Senior Executive Service (S.E.S.) is the corps of executives selected for their leadership qualifications and charged with leading the continuing government transformation. These leaders possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad government perspective and a public service commitment grounded in the Constitution. As the leaders of our federal civilian workforce, Senior Executives strive each day to create a more citizen-centered, result-oriented Federal Government.</p>
        
        <h3>Specialized Positions</h3>
        <p>The Naval Intelligence Office hires many different career specialists, including but not limited to engineers (aerospace, computer, electronic, mechanical, general, and naval architecture), scientists (mathematicians and physicists), intelligence specialists, information technology specialists, security specialists, and police officers, each contributing to critical areas such as design, development, analysis, security, and facility protection.</p>
        <p>Informational packets for specific positions may be found on their website. For example, we will focus on Intelligence Specialist job postings, as this is a continuous recruitment. Candidates must be U.S. citizens, pass background and employment checks, and must be able to be employed by a federal agency.</p>
        
        <p><strong> A few special requirements must be considered for selectees. </strong></p>
<p>Selectee may be required to complete a 2-year trial period.</p>
<p>Individuals must meet the Office of Personnel Management (O.P.M.) qualification standards of 1 year of specialized experience equivalent to the next lower grade level to the position filled and any Individual Occupational Requirements (I.O.R.) for the series/grade selected as identified within the standard set by the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>Candidates must obtain and maintain a Top Secret security clearance and access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (S.C.I.). It must be included on your resume.</p>
<p>Selectee may be required to complete a polygraph examination and drug testing successfully.</p>

        <h3>Benefits and Work Schedules</h3>
<h4>Benefits of working for ONI are generous and designed to maintain the health and happiness of those employed under their branch.</h4>

        <p><strong>Their work schedules are also classed into three categories to offer maximum flexibility to promote success for their agents.</strong></p>   
        <p>Compressed Work Schedule (C.W.S.) – Most of the employee’s work schedule includes nine hours with one day off during the two-week pay period.</p>
        <p>Gliding Work Schedule</p>
        <p>Flexi-tour – Employees work five, 8-hour weekdays with preselected starting and stopping times.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Pay Scale</h3>
        <p>Pay scale is similar to those in other federal agencies, with the grade system employed. There are also cost-of-living raises available for those who operate within a more economically taxing area.</p>
