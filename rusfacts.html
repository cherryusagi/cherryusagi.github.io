        <h2>Boots vs Character Shoes</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
        <p>The dance style determines the shoes worn by the dancers they will be performing. The sturdy, usually lacing boots provide support around the ankle. Traditionally, women's boots are red and men's are black, although this can vary from costume to costume. The folklore members often connect with boot producers back home, and fitting these shoes is a very particular task. The slight heel provides a strong base for striking the ground during sharp, quick dances, and the silhouette's flattering shape provides uniformity. This principle is borrowed from ballet and Russian cultural attitudes; shoes standing out from scuffs or unpolished leather are highly frowned upon. The characters shown below are representative of a more delicate and graceful movement pattern. Grand, flourishing movements and soft, light steps are achievable with the heeled shoe. The strap is always one across the bridge of the foot, nothing more or less. Like the ribbons on pointe shoes, this small strip helps the foot articulate better through the arch. Each dancer is unique in their preference for the brand, although heel height and color are mandated by performance.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the heels on shoes for long hours of intensive dancing may be thought of as counterintuitive. However, a heel of this height aligns the dancer's spine and hips better over her feet. Every shoe is made of leather, and leather only. Therefore, these shoes are investment purchases and are treated as such and imported as a genuine crafted treasure. Breathable, natural materials are the foundation of each shoe, and even as technology advances, the sacred methods to produce such beautiful dance boots are highly prized. </p>

        <h2>E-Commerce</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
        <p>The websites where these items are purchased may seem unimportant, but they reflect a greater theme from their home countries to American dance companies. The sites are often designed entirely in Russian and, when translated, provide broken, brief descriptions of the product. This is done intentionally; most businesses rely on word of mouth, even in the digital age. These operations are usually run by women, crafted by women, and received by the women who are members of this folklore group. Those who have left Russia still participate and interact with those back home, doing the same job they are now. Ballet costumes and tutu designers are often from Russia or Ukraine, keeping tradition and craft alive through digital commerce. Especially with the war, a mass exodus of talented artisans and dancers has displaced thousands of jobs. However, the human connection established on the ground has prevented the loss of such beautiful art and helped to preserve and supply thousands of companies across the globe. Websites like Etsy show the seller's location and a surprising number show Russian or speak the Russian language. Pictured below is an advertisement for character shoes for the Russian-speaking web.</p>

        <h2>Embroidery Styles, Tradition Alive</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
      <p>There are many different types of Russian embroidery, which are still preserved art and used widely within traditional Folk Dance attire. For example, Krestetskaya embroidery often features motifs inspired by nature, such as flowers, birds, and animals, and is traditionally done on linen or cotton fabric. This makes it ideal for ladies' skirts, traditional handkerchiefs, and aprons. As seen on the models below, Gorodet embroidery is characterized by its bold, contrasting colors and distinctive stitch patterns. This style typically features floral and geometric designs with symmetrically arranged motifs. Embroidery is still an incredibly time-intensive task, and embroidery machines have been employed at the studio for long stretches, such as lining a skirt. However, the smaller pieces, intricate details, and extremely important costumes still require all this work to be done by hand. Consequently, as costumes age, so does the integrity of their material and the likelihood it will stand for. Intense machine embroidery declines significantly, requiring work to be done by hand again. Although not strictly embroidery, Vologda lace is a renowned Russian textile tradition that involves intricate lace-making techniques. From the Vologda region, Vologda lace is characterized by its fine, delicate patterns and intricate floral motifs, often created using needlepoint or bobbin lace techniques. The techniques for creating lace are incredibly time-intensive, and we import most of the Russian lace used for our productions. However, the oldest costumes may still contain delicate, priceless pieces of this dying art. The folklore group members are, of course, the thankless maintainers of the expansive costume vault. They have passed down the knowledge of how to care for and clean these garments, and it is a widely kept secret how exactly we make sure our costumes don't smell. (It's vodka) </p>

        <h2>Paper Dolls</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
      <p>A quick highlight I'd like to mention is the prevalence of paper dolls and their niche culture within this particular studio. It began as a tradition from some long-standing former members who have moved on. Donating children's books, mostly in Russian, and many of them included paper dolls. Little girls often sit and watch the older ladies train and perform; their inspiration is limitless. During the Christmas performances that often overlap with the Nutcracker, it is traditional for older girls to gift a younger girl a book of paper dolls. The mothers secretly take pride in the best wrapping job, which serves as one of the most cherished holiday traditions that helps ease the familiar tension during stressful holiday months.</p>

        <h2>Tiaras!</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
        <p>One of my most cherished memories is seeing the plastic boxes of Tiaras stacked up at the back of the studio, ready for performance night. During tech week, long, long hours were worked by both students, especially parents. A group of mothers would spend hours meticulously gluing string pearls, individual rhinestones, and gold trimming onto an absurd amount of crowns. The ones with seamstress experience sat on the other side of the back studio, exchanging chatty conversation amidst the buzz of sewing machines. It was akin to a hive of buzzing bees, with a few running around checking boxes, lists, and measurements to ensure production ran as smoothly as possible, and all for free. Below are two variations of a particular crown that can be bought online; however, it is not. The mothers begin with the upholstered Tiara base, usually sturdy brocade, and hand-sew it into place. Then begins designing, testing, and gathering materials, even before the crafts ultimately begin. Once an agreement is reached, the steps are only relayed verbally; participants outside these instructions are unaware of the intense effort it takes to create showstopping headpieces. </p>
