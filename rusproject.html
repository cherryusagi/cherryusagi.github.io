        <p>For my ethnographic research, most of it includes explanations of the culture behind this group and the behaviours/psychological reasoning of members. This page presents the interpretation and research, and the "Fun Facts" page presents more insight into the history, traditions, and specific examples of how these women work incredibly hard behind the scenes and help to carry on the tradition of Russian Folk Dancing. </p>

        <h2>Top Takeaways</h2>
        </header>
    <article class="post-content">
        <p> The world of Ballet and dance culture can be cutthroat and ruthless. It may appear graceful and divine on the surface, but literal blood, sweat, and tears make up most of the training these young dancers undergo. But who works behind the scenes to create these magnificent productions? The Russian Dance Moms (patent pending) are unsung heroes of the theatre world, working tirelessly to create costumes and sets. These women are the main trendsetters in the social culture of the studio.</p>
        <p>Throughout my research, I interviewed one of the longest-standing members of this material folk group. I explored her perspectives and insights into what keeps this well-oiled machine running smoothly. These women-centered spaces can often walk a thin line regarding keeping the peace and maintaining harmony, which is a delicate balance, especially with a strong-willed cultural identity already baked into their mindset. Dance studios are often fraught with stress, responsibility, and unmanageable workloads, but perseverance and friendships are invaluable. Not only for the young dancers but perhaps for the mothers who now have a community to call their own. </p>

        <h2>Interview Preparation</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
        <p>For this interview, I was not allowed to film or record my interview. This was foreign to me, but it was a welcome change. Taking notes via pen and paper allowed natural storytelling to take place. I came up with a few loose questions and printed them out. This paper helped tremendously to start conversations or make sure my information was as whole and correct as I needed it to be, and if there was a lull in the dialogue, we could recenter ourselves. This felt more like a casual conversation with a family friend than a formal interview, and I believe this factor was encouraging and helped her feel more comfortable. The subject and I already know one another, and she is the great-aunt of one of my closest dance companions. I know her fairly well, although the insight into her social circles was unlike anything I've ever seen.</p>
        <p>I also brought snacks and tea with me, purchased from World Market. Food can be taboo in a ballet studio, but Julienne and the other ladies enjoy their tea and perhaps a cheeky cookie to go alongside. Other ways I prepared included researching Russian terms I knew I would use often and practicing their pronunciation. Although Russian Troupe Dance uses the language very much, the foundation of all dance is ballet, which uses French terminology. I wanted to pay as much respect as possible towards Juli, as her help and agreement for the interview was an extremely large help.</p>

        <h2>Culture Clash</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
     <p>Moving to an unfamiliar city is daunting; moving halfway across the globe to a different country, language, and society is almost unthinkable. One often thinks of the stress of a language barrier and social norms broken or unfollowed, but one often has to think deeply about the community. Immigrants often settle into groups with one another, which can help build and maintain their culture and, at the same time, innovate and create an entirely new one. The dance studio is not only a place to hone one's craft and education but a micro-community in and of itself. The families that interact here often see each other for holidays and special events; little girls play in the yard while their mothers rejoice in finally finding a new friend who is just like them. These communities are essential not only for the social development of children but also for the greater American cultural melting pot. These women exchange dishes, wisdom, stories, traditions, and crafts, introducing new forms of art and, at the same time, helping to maintain the past. The folk group these women are a part of is invaluable for them but should be encouraged and celebrated.</p><p>There are deeper cultural notions, too, such as these women often being stay-at-home mothers and homeschoolers who are deeply involved in their children's lives, sometimes to the point of smothering. Mothers cannot be blamed for wanting the best for their children, but the line gets crossed when it detriments the learning or experience of another child. This can be hard to manage, especially with many parents spending hours at the studio; it can create an almost hostile environment if not managed correctly. It often is the unofficial duty of the oldest women to keep the peace, and their little community functions with a level of innate respect and understanding that is hard, if ever, violated.</p>

        <h2>Art and Heritage</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
      <p>These women's tireless efforts are not taken in vain. Instead, the countless unpaid hours are all for the benefit of their students and to share the culture with others. The practice of creating costumes, set pieces and backdrops, lighting assistance, and dressing room aids are the services these mothers dedicate themselves to out of the goodness of their hearts, desire for connection, and proudly showing off the art they are a part of and helped create. </p> <p>For example, the dressing room is a hub of activity during rehearsals and performances, and these mothers help manage and offer help in emergencies. Countless offered bobby pins, makeup redone, and costumes stitched on the fly make it all worth it in their eyes. There is a camaraderie that is rare in the studio itself; all mothers will band together, regardless of child ownership, to assist in whatever way they need. This bond is strong and can be seen when all of them huddle around the backstage TV, mugs gripped in white-knuckled fingers, anticipating the next move of their dancers. Will the headpiece stay on? How do the costumes look? Does the set need to be cleaned? Refinished? Not only do they aid in physical tasks, but often, bookkeeping and managerial duties will be unofficially assigned, helping to alleviate the stress of the ballet mistress. Their hard work is often thankless, but it does not go unnoticed. If it hadn't been for Juli's meticulous list-keeping a few years back, the female dancers' costumes would've been left at the studio. This is all to say that the women who create these shows by hand deserve our respect, and looking into their smaller cultural groups can show larger reflections of our own society as a whole</p>

        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="post-content">
        <p>I have been a part of this folk group for almost my entire childhood and young adulthood, and the experiences I have shared with my fellow dancers are cherished moments. However, my observation of these women has always been as an outsider. I have seen many new faces come and go throughout the seasons, adjusting my headpiece and doing up my bodice similarly. Some are more well-liked than others, and part of the outsider's experience is being able to feel that tension. It's palpable that if two mothers who do not like each other are present in the same room, it is civil, but there is an intangible unease in the air that settles heavily. The hierarchy between these women is unique because an outsider can understand it. Having been a part of dance for so long, the industry itself may outwardly discourage such behavior, but elitist culture is a disease that unfortunately festers in dance studios. Especially during my ballet training, the cutthroat, do-anything-to-get-ahead mindset was almost a characteristic, but still very much accurate. Films like "Black Swan" dramatize events, but working hard to get ahead can still be underpinned by more sinister intentions. </p>
